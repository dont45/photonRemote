# photonRemote
Remote Photon Node, companion to photonAlarm, which reads monitors temperature at remote site.

A remote node type has been added to photonAlarm as a Particle Cloud based device.  This remote device monitors the temperature via an MCP9808 precision thermometer attached to the Photon via I2C and periodically published the temperature to the Particle Cloud.  The photonAlarm has a device type associated with a remote node and captures the published data via a handler, which updates the reading and timestamp of the  photonAlarm's device associated with this sensor.  The readSensor method continuously scans all of the sensors and makes alert decisions based upon parameters set within the device.  For a thermometer and also for this remote Node which functions as a thermometer, the two limit parameters, alert_min and alert_max are used to determine if the reported temperature should generate an alert.  The first implementation of this remote device is a 'car pet temperature monitor'.  The remote node hardware is very simple.  It consists of a Particle Electron and a MCP9808 precision thermometer.  The device is powered via USB.  It is set to report the temperature every 10 minutes or if the temperature increases by more than 5 degrees.  The readings are captured and processed by the master photonAlarm, which sends a Pushover Alert upon each of the new values received.  This serves as both a temperature alert and a 'worry' alert.
